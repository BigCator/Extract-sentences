Since its emergence in the 1960s, ESP has become a key aspect of language teaching and
research. This paper traces the last 30 years of this journey to show its emergence from the
periphery of applied linguistics to a serious force on the world stage. To do this we use
bibliometric techniques to track changes in ESP research through an analysis of all 3,500
papers on the Social Science Citation Index since 1990 dealing with ESP topics. We identify
which topics have been most prevalent and which authors, publications, journals and
countries most inﬂuential over time. The results indicate that classroom practices remain
central to the discipline and that there has been a consistent interest in specialised texts,
particularly written texts, and in higher education and business English, with a massive
increase in attention devoted to identity and academic and workplace discourses. The
global
interest in these questions is shown by the range of authors, diversity of
geographical sources and the uptake of papers in a range of ﬁelds. We believe our ﬁndings
may interest both ESP professionals in identifying crucial publishing areas and academics
fascinated by the emergence of a new discipline.

English for Speciﬁc Purposes distinguishes itself from more general language study through a focus on particular, pur-
poseful uses of language, or what Cummins (1982) refers to as ‘context-reduced’ language. This tends to be generally more
abstract and less dependent on the immediate setting for its coherence than everyday language use. A commitment to
language instruction that attends to students’ speciﬁc purposes for learning English has given ESP a unique place in the
development of both theory and innovative practice in language instruction since the term ﬁrst emerged in the 1960s. With
countless students and professionals around the world now required to gain ﬂuency in the conventions of their particular
communicative domain of English to steer their learning and promote their careers, ESP has consolidated and expanded its
role. It is now a major player in both research and pedagogy in applied linguistics, with a large and growing contribution from
researchers around the world.

These changing research concerns and sources are the topic of this paper. Adopting a bibliometric approach, we explore
the literature over the past 30 years (1990–2020) to trace the interests of the ﬁeld during a formative part of its emergence as
a discipline. Following our earlier paper looking at how research in EAP has evolved (Hyland & Jiang, 2021), we seek to identify
changes in the research themes, prominent journals, books, papers and authors of ESP together with its geographical sources,
and its citing ﬁelds. Speciﬁcally, we address these ﬁve questions:

1. ESP: characteristics and contexts

English for Speciﬁc Purposes is based around the simple idea of researching and delivering speciﬁc, learner-centred
language instruction. Early on, Peter Strevens (1977) distinguished ESP in terms of: the primacy it gave to language-using
purposes, the need to align curricular content with learner goals, and the use of appropriate teaching methods. The ﬁeld
emerged in the early 1960s as a response to the increasing globalisation of world markets and the growth of English as a
commercial lingua franca to facilitate this (e.g. Hutchinson & Waters, 1987). In this context, language teachers found
themselves teaching technical English to non-native students and needing information about their discourses to do so
(Swales, 1988). ESP thus grew out of text-based counts of grammar features in written technical documents, which quickly
gave way to more explanatory models which sought to connect technical lexico-grammar and authors’ rhetorical purposes.
This interest in what particular groups are seeking to do with language coalesces around the core concept of learner needs.
It is the various views of this concept which inform ESP’s focus on discourse features and text structures and which has
pushed its expansion into ever more genres and professional areas. ESP is aided in this enterprise by a receptiveness to
different research perspectives and methods and a strong desire to marry theory and practice (Anthony, 2019; Belcher, 2009;
Johns, 2013). ESP, then, is an approach to language education based on identifying the speciﬁc language features, discourse
practices, and communicative skills of target groups while recognising the subject-matter needs and expertise of learners
(Hyland, 2006).

ESP is often seen as having two branches, English for Academic Purposes and English for Occupational Purposes (e.g. Orr,
2002; Ramírez, 2015), with ever-increasing sub-divisions and their equally proliferating acronyms (e.g. Dudley-Evans & St
John, 1998). However, as Belcher observes:

There are, and no doubt will be, as many types of ESP as there are speciﬁc learner needs and target communities that
learners wish to thrive in. (Belcher, 2009: 2)

The picture is further complicated by hybrids such as English for Academic Legal Purposes (EALP) to describe courses for
those studying law rather than practising it, who might need English for Legal Purposes (ELP). Subtypes abound, and the
British Council1 includes Survival English for immigrants and English for Hotel Management among the branches of ESP. Such
proliferation of types, and their pedagogic value to growing numbers of clients, has helped establish ESP as a leading area of
language education.

There have been numerous attempts to map ESP’s evolution, largely by luminaries of the ﬁeld drawing on their knowledge
of its main areas and interests. Hutchinson and Waters (1987) and Dudley-Evans and St John (1998), for instance, see a
movement from register analysis to greater concern with discourse, target situations, identiﬁcation of needs, and skills. Upton
(2012) identiﬁes a similar movement from ‘words and structures’ to ‘texts and purposes’, to ‘learners and genres’ to ‘contexts
and interactions’. Johns (2013) also traces four periods, each of ten years, in the life of ESP as it moved away from text-based
counts of grammatical features to rhetorical analysis, the introduction of genre and moves, the dominance of genre, and a
future characterised by expansion of methodologies, geographical regions and growing attention to multimodalities.

Reviews have also sought to identify the key areas of ESP (e.g. Belcher, 2009; Paltridge & Starﬁeld, 2011), with needs
analysis, genre, corpus studies, and specialised language skills and lexis ﬁguring prominently. Handbooks add themes such as
disciplinary variation, intercultural rhetoric, English as a Lingua Franca and critical perspectives to these (Hyland & Shaw,
2016; Paltridge & Starﬁeld, 2013). Beyond these impressionistic surveys, some studies have systematically examined pub-
lished papers to distinguish key aspects of the ﬁeld, focusing on the ﬂagship journals English for Speciﬁc Purposes (ESPJ) and
Journal of English for Academic Purposes (JEAP) (e.g. Johns, 2013; Master, 2005; Paltridge & Starﬁeld, 2011). Hewings (2002), for
example, analysed papers published in ESPJ between 1980 and 2001, ﬁnding a gradual trend towards a predominance of
written discourse analysis, largely concerned with published, rather than student texts. Gollin-Kies (2014) conﬁrms this focus
in papers published in the two journals between 2003 and 2013 while Swales and Leeder (2012) found that the top 15 most
cited papers in ESPJ between 1990 and 1999 dealt with the discourse of written texts.

These impressionistic accounts have very recently been supplemented by more quantitative studies using bibliometric
techniques. Liu and Hu (2021), for example, used scientometrics to analyse the co-citation patterns of 1092 articles and their
25,147 unique references of papers in ESPJ and JEAP between 1980 and 2018. They identiﬁed 11 clusters of co-cited references,
representing the ﬁeld’s major areas of research in three phases. They label these the conceptualizing stage (1970s–1990s)
focused on needs analysis; the maturing stage (1990s–2000s) characterized by major methodological approaches, and the
ﬂourishing stage (2000s-), featuring the growth of diverse research interests. In a wider study, we used bibliometric methods
to explore the main trends in EAP in 40 Web of Science indexed journals from 1980 to 2020 (Hyland & Jiang, 2021). Using a

different method, we identiﬁed 12,600 articles and discovered that while topics concerning teaching, learning and classroom
practices continue to characterise the ﬁeld, those with a focus on contexts and discourses have increased since 2001, with
growing interest in identity, interaction and genre. The most cited authors and publications also show a marked shift towards
an interest in academic writing and social interaction.

In the present study we use bibliometric techniques to analyse relevant themes, methods, authors and cited works in
Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) journals since 1990, a year which marks the start of what Johns’ (2013) calls ESP’s ‘modern
age’, where many of the central concepts had been established. This, then is the point at which the ﬁeld is starting to be taken
seriously in applied linguistics and language teaching and when the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) was introduced, thus
providing a way for individuals, institutions, and governments to rank valued journals. We start at the point where ESP is
taking off. We hope our ﬁndings will both contribute to a better understanding of the ﬁeld of ESP and also suggest how it has
matured as a central area of study.

2. Methodology

2.1. Approach

Bibliometrics is “the application of mathematics and statistical methods to the analysis of academic publications”
(Pritchard, 1969: 348). It is used in library and information sciences to describe patterns of publication within a given ﬁeld or
body of literature and has helped to explore research networks (González-Alcaide, Jinseo, Huamaní, Gascón & Rincón., 2012),
authorial collaboration (Davarpanah & Aslekia, 2008), and publication gender inequalities (Sebo, Maisonneuve & Fournier,
2020). Most famously, the fact it facilitates the quantitative evaluation of publications, journals, and authors means that it
informs the Science Citation Index and is often used to study the research productivity of individual scholars and countries
(Liu, Hu, Tang & Wang, 2015; Ma, Li & Chen, 2014).

Studies have not, however, generally sought to identify the most popular research themes, highly cited authors, or
publications in a ﬁeld. Liu and Hu (2021) and Hyland and Jiang (2021), are among the exceptions to this. The current paper
differs from these, however, by a) prioritising relevant topics rather than journals and b) by scouring the entire indexed
literature to do so.

2.2. Corpus

To address our research questions we ﬁrst created a corpus of ESP-relevant articles. To do this we focused on those themes
at the heart of the ﬁeld, dealing with the teaching and research of English in specialized areas. We see theme as comprising
topics and methods of analysis and relied here on two sources of information. First, the Statement of Aims in the journal of
English for Speciﬁc Purposes, which lists the following areas of interest:

second language acquisition in specialized contexts, needs assessment, curriculum development and evaluation,
materials preparation, discourse analysis, descriptions of specialized varieties of English, teaching and testing, the
effectiveness of approaches to language learning and teaching and the training of teachers of ESP.2

To these items we added others regarded as key areas by the editors of the Handbook of English for Speciﬁc Purposes

(Paltridge & Starﬁeld, 2013) which include:

medical, academic, nursing, workplace, business, legal English, aviation, science and technology, professional, and
occupational English.

We took each of these themes and searched ALL the journal abstracts in the entire SSCI collections on the Web of Science

(WoS).

We chose to survey the Web of Science databases from the ‘core collections’ as these contain the prestigious SSCI listed
journals and represent the most recognised sources of excellence in research endeavour. This approach differs from our
earlier paper looking at EAP as there we included many papers that were not SSCI indexed. Alternative sources such as Google
Scholar and Scopus have a wider coverage, but neither ensure the same rigorous quality control. Google Scholar is a search
engine covering the whole internet which produces results based on machine automated matching criteria and Scopus is very
variable in quality and includes non-peer reviewed journals. WoS includes 12,000 high impact journals made on the basis of
impact evaluations and contains over 79 million papers. While SSCI indexed papers may not be representative of the vast
output of ESP scholarship, they exemplify what is best recognised and valued by the community. This work, then, might be
expected to be the most visible, most read, most cited and so most inﬂuential on research conducted in ESP (see also Lei & Liu,
2019; Zhang, 2020).

We deﬁned the search span as 1990 to 2020. This was partly because 1990 is when the SSCI begun and tracking from that
date gives a consistent quality to the texts in the corpus. We also wanted to offer a quantitative supplement to more
impressionistic studies in the literature and extend work after the major reviews ending in 2000 (Hewings, 2002; Swales &

Leeder, 2012). As we described above, this encompasses the period where ESP has emerged from its beginnings in needs
assessment, statistical grammar counts, local newsletters and international British Council teaching projects (Johns, 2013;
Swales, 2020). The Journal of Second Language Writing, publishing articles overlapping ESP interests started in 1991 while the
ﬂagship journal ESP had been running for a decade. Swales seminal Genre Analysis was published that year and would
transform how academic writing was seen and taught. For Johns (2013), 1990 marks the beginning of the ‘modern period’ of
ESP: the point where it became of age and its key concepts gained currency.

This search of the WoS yielded 3,467 SSCI articles published since 1990 containing reference to the search themes. For
these papers we downloaded all the accompanying data, of titles, keywords, abstracts, reference lists and author names and
afﬁliations. Figure 1 shows the distribution of these publications across the years. We can see a remarkable increase in the
number of publications after 2005, and because of this we chose this as a cut-off, enabling us to trace the change before and
after this shift. The ﬁrst period 1990 to 2004 contains 535 articles and the second from 2005 to 2020 has 2,932.

2.3. Data searches

We then probed these three corpora to answer our research questions, pursuing the same areas as we addressed in our

EAP paper (Hyland & Jiang, 2021):

(1) The most frequently explored themes overall and in each period
(2) The most cited authors overall and in each period
(3) The most cited books, chapters and articles in the two periods
(4) The most productive countries/regions over the two periods
(5) The most active journals publishing and citing ESP papers

Question 1, regarding themes, we addressed in the following way:

1) Annotated all the identiﬁed abstracts with part-of-speech and lemma information3 using Schmid’s (1995) TreeTagger

programme (c.f. Lei & Liu, 2019).

2) Searched the tagged corpora to identify all nouns and n-grams of 2–5 words using AntConc (Anthony, 2019) to identify

candidate themes.

3) Filtered the n-grams using an automatic process (using stop words) to exclude function words (modals, pronouns, etc)

which do not occur in research topic phrases.

4) Manually checked all remaining cases to exclude phrases which did not constitute research themes.

To identify potential themes we focused on nouns, which offer a more productive way of capturing themes than other
parts of speech, and on 2–5 word n-grams, which gave us a realistic chance to identify themes such as professional

3 A lemma is the dictionary or citation form of a word, e.g. run, runs, ran and running are indexed by the lemma ‘run’. This ensured that we captured all

examples of a form.

development (2-word gram) and Listening comprehension of academic lectures (5-word gram). In this process we rejected items
in three categories: a) words and clusters common in general language use (seem to and in depth), b) concepts and themes not
speciﬁc to ESP (response to, signiﬁcant difference, the ﬁndings suggest) and c) concepts and issues common in ESP but too
general to be useful (e.g. meaning, Non-native English Speaker) (see Lei & Liu, 2019).

In addition to these stipulations, we only included themes if they met a threshold frequency of at least 30 occurrences. This
follows Lei and Liu (2019) and Hyland and Jiang (2021) who regard this frequency as high enough to ensure that the selected
items were signiﬁcant in the texts, but not so high as to exclude important areas. We also included a range criterion to
guarantee a topic was sufﬁciently widespread in the literature, so that only items which occurred in 10% or more of the
publications were included. We then normalised the frequencies by representing the number of occurrences of each theme
per 100 papers to allow comparisons between time periods. Finally, we ran a one-way chi-square test for each of the themes
across the two periods to determine statistical differences in their frequencies.

Questions 2 and 3 concern the most prominent authors and publications. Here we used frequency counts to identify the
most-cited authors in the references of the papers in each period. To ﬁnd the titles of the most highly cited publications, we
used a regular expression search to discover the frequencies of all the books, chapters, and articles from the reference lists of
the articles in the corpus.

Question 4 concerns the most productive countries in ESP publishing and here we extracted the afﬁliation of every author

of every paper in the corpus.

Question 5 addresses the journals publishing and citing ESP research. To answer this we used a Web of Science facility to
ﬁnd all the citations the ESP papers had gained and generated a list of the journal sources contained in them. Finally, both
authors examined the results independently to check our results and resolve a small number of problematic cases.

3. Results and discussion

In this section we discuss our ﬁndings taking each research question in turn.

3.1. The most frequently studied themes

We understand themes to include both the issues explored and the means of exploring them, thus comprising both topics
and methods. The criteria discussed in Section 3.3 (at least 10 occurrences in at least 20 papers) produced 172 frequently
discussed research themes over the 30 years. Each period produced a number of new topics as the ﬁeld expanded, with 134 in
the second period. Table 1 shows the topics which statistically rose and fell overall, with raw and normed frequency for each
period and the total number of papers the items occurred in. The themes are organised by their percentage change in normed
frequency.

Quite clearly, several of these themes have shown quite dramatic increases in popularity over the years, with professional
development, genre, corpus, assessment, curriculum, literacy and discourse up more than 66% per 100 papers. The massive rise of
interest in professional development since 1990 is a consequence of a growing professionalism in the ﬁeld and the desire of
practitioners to both improve their classroom skills and their identities as academics (e.g., Ding & Bruce, 2017).

We can also see in these items the impact of ESP inﬂuencers, such as the editors of ESPJ, who made serious efforts towards
the end of the 1980s to expand the horizons of the movement and make it more relevant to the applied linguistics/TESOL
community (Johns, 2013). We therefore see no mention of needs or register, which were ESP staples of the early days (Dudley-
Evans & St John, 1998; Upton, 2012). The areas of science and technology, and a focus on courses, sentence level analysis and
reading have also declined signiﬁcantly. Such changes might be expected from a new and rapidly growing area of study.

Table 2 shows the themes which remained relatively constant overall. We can see a very small statistical fall in almost all of
these items (normed to 100 papers), but they represent the most consistent frequencies in the corpus. We also show here the
range or number of papers they occurred in. Here we can see a continuing interest in writing, instruction, business English,
higher education and the role of community. These have remained mainstays of ESP over the entire period.

Table 3 shows the themes that appear to be emerging and receding over the period. Here the ﬁgures are presented in
comparison with the earlier period (raw numbers, per 100 papers, number of papers). Here interest in identity and lingua
franca, the latter increasingly found in the business world and other workplaces, have increased considerably. In ESP class-
rooms feedback has seen a strong showing in the research literature, but Interaction has been one of the most popular topics
since 2005 and is now a mainstay of much EAP work through stance, engagement, metadiscourse, appraisal and other ap-
proaches (e.g. Hyland & Jiang, 2019).

In terms of research methods, discourse, corpus and genre analysis are all signiﬁcant climbers in Table 1, having replaced
questionnaire research (Table 3). So, as our understanding of needs has developed, so too has the ways to explore these needs,
ﬁnding answers in the interactions that occur in the speciﬁc discourses and genres used by students and professional
communities.

Together, these changes in topics, methods and foci suggest a movement away from a broader view of EFL: it also an-

nounces a unique research space being carved out for a new disciplinary endeavour.

3.2. Most cited authors

This evolution towards a distinctive disciplinary character can also be seen in the ﬁeld’s most inﬂuential authors. To
identify these we conducted a frequency count of the reference lists in our corpus of 3,467 research articles, divided them into
two time periods, and normalised the results to 100 papers. Table 4 lists the top 15 authors in each period, together with their
raw and normalised citation counts.

An interesting feature of the table is that half the authors span both lists, indicating a certain consistency of interests and
consolidation of a distinctive disciplinary dramatis personae of recognisable names. Swales, Hyland, Bhatia and Flowerdew are
among the most identiﬁable authors in ESP and their work is prominent in the two lists. Other major ﬁgures over the 30 years
are the linguists Michael Halliday and Douglas Biber, the social theorist Pierre Bourdieu and the critical sociolinguist Alistair

Pennycook. All eight have contributed to the understanding of specialised language use in various ways and inﬂuenced the
development of the ﬁeld.

Swales, through his work on genre and community-speciﬁc language practices, has been a seminal inﬂuence of course and
his approach to specialised language analysis and description has been taken up in different ways by Hyland, Flowerdew and
Bhatia. Hyland’s work on the importance of interactive features in scholarly discourse and Bhatia’s on genre in legal and
professional practice have encouraged considerable research in these areas. Biber, with corpus informed analyses of varia-
tions in register and mode, and Bourdieu, by introducing the inﬂuential concepts of cultural, social, and symbolic forms of
capital as well as cultural reproduction and habitus, have both made a lasting impression on either the methods or un-
derstandings of the ﬁeld. Halliday’s inﬂuence, of course, can be seen in the considerable work conducted using Systemic
Functional Linguistics in ESP and its continuing interest in the role of choice and dialogue in the creation of meanings.

Flowerdew, together with Pennycook, Fairclough and Canagarajah, have established the importance of asking critical
questions in studying discourse and language education. Fairclough, the founding father of critical discourse analysis, and
Pennycook have encouraged us to reﬂect on the wider political implications of global English while Canagarajah has been
consistent in recognising vernacular languages in education through translingualism and the speciﬁc needs of migrants. The
importance of discourse in ESP is also indexed in the citations given to Carolyn Miller, James Gee and Jan Blommaert. Miller for
her ideas on genre as social action in the ﬁrst period and to Gee, whose work on studying communication in its cultural
settings, and to Blommaert, for his contributions on discourse and the impact of language and globalisation. Together with the
concepts of discourse and critical analysis, the notion of community as a decisive factor in language use and learning has also
had a decisive impact on work in ESP and this accounts for the appearance of Vygotsky and Lave in the earlier list.

The role of culture in language use and learning has also been a strong theme of ESP throughout the period. Robert Kaplan’s
thought-provoking work on cultural differences in thinking and writing has continued to be debated. This can be seen in the
second period by the citations to English as Lingua Franca scholars such as Jenkins and Seidelhofer in describing how cultural
forms, practices, and frames of reference inﬂuence communications among individuals who do not share the same ﬁrst
language. Janet Holmes is a more central ﬁgure in ESP as a result of her work in workplace communication.

Key pedagogical inﬂuences on ESP in the earlier period were Ann Johns, and her energetic work supporting L2 un-
dergraduates through genre and collaborations with discipline-speciﬁc faculty. Another heavily cited presence on the ﬁrst list
is Michael Fullan, with his inﬂuential views of pedagogy and the cultivation of deep learning, especially using digital tools and
collaboration. This pedagogical strand of research is represented by Rod Ellis in the later period through his work on tasks,
although Swales’ contributions to teaching ESP at graduate levels has also been signiﬁcant.

3.3. Most inﬂuential publications

We assume here that the most inﬂuential publications in a period are those which have received the most citations.
Citation, of course, is the standard means by which authors acknowledge the source of their methods, ideas and ﬁndings, and
is widely used as a rough measure of a paper’s importance. In ESP, however, this is complicated by the fact that research may
not only be measured in terms of its impact on subsequent research, but on the effects it has in language classrooms. Ideas and
ﬁnding may be taken up in policy changes, innovations to curricula, and in teachers’ choices of materials, texts and
instructional methods, rather than in other research. We cannot, then, say that other publications, speciﬁcally addressed to
practitioners, have not had an equal impact on the ﬁeld.

There are also other confounding factors here. Citations may be skewed by self-citation or negative citations, for example,
although their inﬂuence seems to be negligible (e.g. Hyland, 2003). More importantly, not only are more works cited as

20

research expands across the period, but also older publications have more time to accrue citations. As a result, bibliome-
tricians tend to compare counts for papers of similar age rather than simply count citation frequencies when they want to
measure a paper’s value (e.g. Cooper, 2015). We acknowledge the citation lag which means that more recent publications may
not be recorded here, but our lists reﬂect something of how the ﬁeld has changed and which publications have been most
inﬂuential in this change to the present. Tables 5 and 6 show the top 15 of the most cited publications taken from the
reference lists of our 3,467 papers

Almost all the authors discussed in the previous section appear somewhere on these publication lists. Some writers in
Table 4, such as Holmes, Johns, Vygotsky and Gee, however, do not appear here as their inﬂuence was presumably dispersed
over a greater number of publications. Nor were the high citations for some works in these tables sufﬁcient to push their
writers onto the inﬂuential authors list. While the raw citation numbers may seem rather low, especially in Table 5, these
ﬁgures refer only to those publications cited in SSCI listed journals on ESP relevant themes. It is likely that these same papers
also received considerable citations in journals in other areas of applied linguistics, perhaps focusing on other topics of
language analysis and pedagogy.

The works on the lists in Tables 5 and 6 fall into ﬁve broad categories, and while some authors or texts might legitimately

be assigned to two groups, the groupings nevertheless indicate the general concerns of the ﬁeld over the period:

K. Hyland, Feng(Kevin) Jiang / English for Speciﬁc Purposes 64 (2021) 13–25

21

1. Textual – concerned with discourse, grammar, etc. (Biber, Hewings, Coxhead)
2. Cultural –cultural inﬂuence and language contact (Holliday, Kaplan, Jenkins)
3. Contextual – disciplinary and community issues (Nickerson, Lave, Myers)
4. Pedagogical – teaching and learning matters (Beijaard et al. Shulman, Lee)
5. Critical – Sociopolitical inﬂuences (Pennycook, Fairclough Canagarajah)

Interestingly, over half the publications in the ﬁrst period comprises books (9), but there has been a substantial shift
towards journal articles over the two periods with just 4 in the 2005–2020 list. While books have been traditionally valued in
the social sciences and tend to be more long-lived, articles offer authors immediate visibility, and institutions have prioritised
these in recent years for government accounting purposes.

Of the 30 slots in the two tables, 17 are ﬁlled by publications whose authors appear only once, while others appear several
times. John Swales’ Genre Analysis, published at the beginning of this survey, tops the ﬁrst list, with an enduring inﬂuence on
the ﬁeld indicated by its nearly 19,000 citations on Google Scholar. Catherine Nickerson’s paper topping Table 6 is actually an
introduction to a special issue on business English and reviews research investigating the role of written and spoken
communication in English and speciﬁc business genres such as negotiations, meetings, e-mail and advertising. Ken Hyland’s
Disciplinary Discourses is the only work appearing in both lists, which shows its considerable staying power in the ﬁeld.
Hyland’s book helped establish an explosion of research over the next 20 years into the relationships between the cultures of
academic communities and their discourses. His work appears a further ﬁve times in these lists, each one highlighting the
signiﬁcance of disciplinary writing conventions or with one paper, Speciﬁcity revisited, an argument for disciplinary-speciﬁc,
rather than general EAP.

Douglas Biber also appears in two lists. Biber’s presence in two periods indicates the importance of corpus research to the
ﬁeld. Variation across speech and writing, published in 1988, used computational techniques to identify variation of linguistic
co-occurrence patterns in a range of spoken and written registers and genres. The work has inspired corpus studies of
specialised texts, whether using Multi-Dimensional Analysis or not. His second paper, with Conrad and Cortes on lexical
bundles in Table 6, provided researchers with a clear example of how to conduct comparative feature analyses across aca-
demic genres. Michael Halliday also has two publications in the lists, both in Table 5, indicating the key importance of his
work to ESP. Issues related to teaching and learning are also well represented, especially in Table 5 where Shulman, Hyland’s
speciﬁcity, Beijaard et al. and Lee have inﬂuenced researchers.

Interestingly there are two papers on lexical bundles in the tables and, together with those on the academic word list and
anticipatory “it”, point to the role of corpus-driven analysis in ESP research. In contrast to a corpus-based approach, this as-
sumes no a-priori framework of linguistic description, as suggested by Halliday’s Systemic Functional Grammar and Cohesion in
English, for example, but discovers information about previously undescribed specialised texts. Several critical texts are highly
cited, notable Fairclough’s Language and power and Pennycook’s book on the cultural and social consequences of English as a
global language and the development of a critical pedagogy for TESOL. The publications by Canagarajah and Blommaert take
up these issues in different ways and show the sense of disquiet that many practitioners within ESP continue to have about
the global role of English in the world.

3.4. Most productive countries/regions

Historically, well ﬁnanced institutions in the West, and particularly the United States, have led scholarly publishing as a
result of huge ﬁnancial investments in research infrastructure, high salaries to attract the proliﬁc authors, and environments

conducive to scholarly networking and publishing. Globalisation, however, has encouraged previously peripheral countries to
raise the status of their universities and their involvement in international publishing. As the competition for international
students and research funding increase, greater pressure is put on academics to publish in prestigious English language
journals. The afﬁliations of authors in our data illustrate this expansion, suggesting both the spread of ESP and the emerging
participation of Asian countries. Table 7 shows, in rank order, the 15 most productive countries and regions in research over
the period using the afﬁliation of every author in the corpus.

Despite the continuing dominance of the USA, England and Australia at the head of each list, the proportion of ESP research
which their authors publish has, with the exception of Australia, declined over the 30 years. Canada, Hong Kong, Germany,
Finland and the Netherlands have all fallen, both in ranking and the percentage of work they have added to the whole, while
Scotland and Northern Ireland have dropped out of the top 15 altogether. Spain, Taiwan, New Zealand, Taiwan, Japan and,
most spectacularly, Mainland China, all increased their positions and contributions to the ESP literature over the period. It is,
however, the ﬂood of work from Asian countries which catches the eye.

Today, South Korea, Japan, Turkey, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong all sit among the heavyweights of academic publishing.
This reﬂects the fact that emerging economies have largely driven the 4–5% per year growth in publishing output in recent
years (UNESCO, 2017). The leading Asian countries, for example, have accounted for 8–12% annual growth in the last few years
compared to around 2.9% for the G8, and just 1% for the US and EU. Turkey, for instance, nearly doubled its share of world
publications to 1.9% between 2008 and 2014 (UNESCO, 2017). Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, has been
at the forefront of international ESP research, with ﬁve universities in the world top 100 (QS, 2020) and a clear demand for a
workforce of English-proﬁcient professionals. Researchers in these English-medium universities have made signiﬁcant and
consistent contributions to ESP over the 30 years and, in particular to the description and teaching of academic texts.

The most striking change is the remarkable growth in China’s rise across the period. A key reason for this is the massive
increase in support for research by the government in recent years (e.g. Zhang, Patton & Kenney, 2013). China’s research
expenditure increased almost 33 times between 1995 and 2013 (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2015) so that articles in
SCI journals written by authors from Chinese institutions increased from 120,000 in 2009 to 450,000 in 2019 (Mallapaty,
2020). Some estimates even suggest that Chinese authors, from anywhere in the world, co-authored 34.5% of all papers
published in 2016 – a 22% increase since 2000 (Xie & Freeman, 2019). China also plans to increase the status of its research by
pumping US$29 million into local journals (Cyranoski, 2019) and has invested heavily in its university system. While not
among the disciplinary powerhouses, researchers engaged in ESP have also proﬁted from these incentives and are working to
help make China’s mark in the ﬁeld.

Our results, of course, are based on author afﬁliations rather than nationality and we can say little about a writer’s country
of origin, ﬁrst language, or ethnic background. Some authors are likely to be expatriates employed in overseas institutions.
What is clear, however, is that scholars working on what was the periphery, are now seeking to engage in this global en-
terprise, so that the majority of authors publishing in prestigious journals are now non-native English speakers (Hyland,
2015). Equally, of course, this expansion of author sources indexes the internationalisation of ESP as a signiﬁcant ﬁeld of
inquiry.

3.5.

Journals publishing and citing papers on ESP

Finally, we analysed our corpus to determine the journals which had published these 3,467 ESP articles during the two
time-periods and then identiﬁed those that had cited them the most. We should point out that some journals may be high on
these lists because of the volume of papers they publish, rather than the proportion of ESP papers that comprise their output.
The Journal of Pragmatics, for example, publishes monthly while Ibérica only twice a year, and so it is likely we see more ESP
papers, and perhaps more citations to those papers, in the former.

Table 8 shows the most popular publishing venues for authors working in ESP, reporting the number of papers published
by each journal and the proportion to the 3,467 articles, covering about 25% of the papers in the ﬁeld over the last 30 years.
Unsurprisingly, ESPJ sits at the top of the list, but a broad range of journals follow it. Some, such as System and ELT Journal are
principally practitioner journals, while others deal with a range of theoretical and empirical areas related to applied lin-
guistics and language education. Along with established high-proﬁle journals such TESOL Quarterly, Applied Linguistics and
Language Teaching Research, we ﬁnd more regionally-oriented journals. Ibérica and RELC Journal, for instance originally
published research from Spain and South East Asia respectively, and The Asia Paciﬁc Education Researcher, showcasing
innovative practice in the Paciﬁc, indicate something of the range of journals publishing ESP studies. Interestingly ESP work
has also surfaced in periodicals less centrally concerned with teaching, such as Journal of Pragmatics, Journal of Multilingual &
Multicultural Development and World Englishes.

The signiﬁcance of ESP as an emerging discipline can also be seen in who is making use of this research, so we collected
information on all the sources of papers citing the articles in our corpus (Table 9). Once again, there is a broad spread of
journals in applied linguistics and ELT, but we can see that ESP research also touches those in wider ﬁelds such as nursing,
medical and science education and psychology. Those working in policy, language planning and computer education have
also made considerable use of the ESP work. Interestingly, the number of different journals citing ESP work may have nar-
rowed in recent years. The ESP papers received 7,379 citations in the ﬁrst period and 22,355 in the second, with the top 15
covering just 17.8% of all citations in 1990–2004 and 43.4% in 2005–2020. Although we cannot say for certain that ESP is now
cited by fewer journals, it seems that the ﬁeld is becoming more focused in its citation patterns.

The range of journals publishing, and citing, ESP research indexes the breadth of the ﬁeld as well as its apparent value to
users. ESP seems to be making particular inroads into being taken seriously by medical and other professional groups as more
non-native English learners seek to acquire to specialised language competencies of their chosen careers.

In this bibliometric study we have sought to track a signiﬁcantly formative period in the life of ESP. Having established
itself as a useful, although perhaps still fringe, element of applied linguistics during its early years, the period 1990 to 2020
saw ESP grow into a mature discipline of global importance. The last 30 years have witnessed signiﬁcant, even dramatic,
increases in the range of its interests, the number and geographical spread of its authors, and the quantity of its books,
journals and research papers. It has spread across the world to encourage the participation of researchers from Iran to Canada
and maintained its pragmatic focus on the needs of classroom practice while building a solid base of research methods and
descriptions of specialised discourses. At the same time, it has become a more reﬂective and critical ﬁeld, recognising the
limitations of its ambitions, the challenges posed by the inequalities inherent in teaching a lingua franca, and its often
marginal status in universities and corporate training departments.

Our data indicate that researchers have shown a consistent interest in specialised texts, particularly written texts, and in
language teaching in higher education and business. There has been a massive increase in the attention they devote to
professional development and to academic and workplace discourses over the period, particularly using corpus and genre
methods which focus on interaction and literacy. But while there has been a decline in issues concerned with accuracy,
reading and sentence-level issues, classroom practices remain central to the discipline and publications discussing assess-
ment, curricula and feedback have all increased. The global interest with these questions is shown, in particular, by the di-
versity of geographical sources of papers and their uptake in a range of ﬁelds.

These publishing and citational data paint a broad strokes picture of what is, of course, a highly nuanced and complex ﬁeld.
Our study, for instance, privileges the top of the pile: the authors, publications and citations of papers indexed in the SSCI
databases. These are the most accessible and celebrated works, but we have neglected the many regional, local and university
publications as well as the teacher action research studies which are never published at all. ESP is a practitioner-oriented and
applied discipline which means that while published studies contributes to the incremental understanding of particular
discourses, communities and learners, it may often be used but uncited. We also have to remember that those who conduct,
and seek to publish, research are often working on the periphery of academia. They teach in university language centres,
further education colleges, and corporate training divisions with little incentive, resources or the support of a positive
research culture, and this acts to constrain the advance of publishing and the future development of the ﬁeld.

What this less widely disseminated research consists of, and who does it, is a potential area of future study, but it is
probable that it reﬂects, and very likely led by, the issues in international publications. What drives ESP research, as much
today as 30 (or 60) years ago, is a concern with specialised discourses, the contexts in which they are found, the demands
these make on users, and the meanings they have for those working in educational and occupational workplaces as well as for
the ﬁeld itself. ESP requires us to step into new domains of experience and explore unfamiliar communicative worlds,
building plausible theories, detailed descriptions, relevant curricula and useful pedagogic tasks. The published literature of
the past 30 years shows that it has consistently attempted to do this, providing grounded insights into the structures and
meanings of texts, the connections between communities and communicative behaviours, and the pedagogic practices by
which these behaviours can be nurtured.
